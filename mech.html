                        <h4>Ultrasonic Sensor - LED Control</h4>
                        <p>In this example, I used an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino to control an LED based on proximity. The ultrasonic sensor detects the distance of an object in front of it, and if the object comes within a certain range, the LED is turned on. If the object moves away, the LED is turned off. This demonstrates how to interface sensors and actuators using simple Arduino programming. Such projects are useful in automation systems where proximity sensing is needed to trigger actions.</p>

                <p>I have extensive experience using SolidWorks, AutoCAD and Inventor to design 3D models, assemblies, and perform simulations. This software allows me to bring my mechanical engineering ideas to life, optimizing designs for performance and manufacturability. I've used SolidWorks in various mechanical projects, including product design and prototyping.</p>
